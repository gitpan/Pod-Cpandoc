NAME
    Pod::Cpandoc - perldoc that works for modules you don't have installed

SYNOPSIS
        cpandoc Acme::BadExample
            -- works even if you don't have Acme::BadExample installed!

        cpandoc -v '$?'
            -- passes everything through to regular perldoc

        cpandoc -tT Acme::BadExample | grep -i acme
            -- options are respected even if the module was scraped

        vim `cpandoc -l Web::Scraper`
            -- getting the idea yet?

SNEAKY INSTALL
        cpanm Pod::Cpandoc

        then: alias perldoc=cpandoc
        or:   function perldoc () { cpandoc "$@" }

        Now `perldoc Acme::BadExample` works!

    "perldoc" should continue to work for everything that you're used to,
    since "cpandoc" passes all options through to it. "cpandoc" is merely a
    subclass that falls back to scraping a CPAN index when it fails to find
    your queried file in @INC.

    The sneaky install was inspired by <https://github.com/defunkt/hub>.
